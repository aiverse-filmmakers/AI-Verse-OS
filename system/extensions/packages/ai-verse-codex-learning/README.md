# AI-Verse connection for Codex desktop

This local extension connects the Codex message lifecycle to the existing AI-Verse OS. It does not replace Memory, Brain, Data, Skills, or the model.

## Message flow

1. Resolve the operator or one workspace and retrieve bounded current context, preferences, and relevant Memory.
2. Give Codex a short preflight and the exact command for reviewing this turn.
3. Observe user/tool evidence as bounded salted hashes, without retaining source bodies in adapter diagnostics.
4. Review within the original turn and submit an empty receipt if nothing deserves retention. Automatic Stop continuations are off by default; opting in can request one additional review.
5. Route eligible candidates to existing owners: historical Memory, operator profile, operational current context, or Brain/Skills proposals. Keep strategy and Data with their owners.
6. Report the actual owner receipt. An unavailable owner produces an explicit proposal in the existing OS inbox.

The model performs the review. Evidence checks establish that quoted words were observed; they do not prove the proposed conclusion. The canonical owner remains the final admission gate.

## Desktop activation

The six project handlers are installed in `.codex/hooks.json`: UserPromptSubmit, SessionStart, PostToolUse, Stop, Interrupt, SessionEnd. In **Codex Settings → Hooks**, review and trust these project handlers. Registration alone does not activate them.

After trust, use this OS project in a fresh local Codex conversation. A production check must observe genuine hook callbacks, scoped context delivery, a review receipt, and fresh-session recall. Bundled engine fixture tests are evidence of the implementation, not proof that the desktop conversation has activated it.

The trusted command includes the bridge source digest. Any code change requires regenerating the definition and renewed review. The installer never writes hook trust records.

## Controls

Run commands with the same installed Python executable shown in `.codex/hooks.json`:

```text
bridge.py status
bridge.py set --enabled false
bridge.py set --enabled true
bridge.py set --review-mode all
bridge.py set --review-mode meaningful
bridge.py set --review-mode off
lifecycle.py install
lifecycle.py remove
```

`all` reviews normal messages, including no-learning receipts. `meaningful` reduces fallback reviews. `off` retains context loading without review continuations. Removing hooks preserves canonical state and other project handlers.

## Boundaries

- Local desktop/project runtime only; local command hooks do not run in cloud orchestration.
- Additional reviews consume Codex usage and can add visible output and latency. Prefer submitting a receipt within the original turn.
- No continuous idle thinking, model weight training, autonomous permission expansion, external API key, or scheduled heartbeat is introduced.
- Scope ambiguity refuses learning rather than expanding retrieval. Profile writes require direct user evidence. Skill activation follows the existing owner mode.
- Interrupt records cancellation promptly and stops subsequent writes when observed. A committed owner write cannot be undone by cancellation.
- Runtime receipts are disposable diagnostics. Durable truth remains in canonical owners.

Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `REVIEW-SCHEMA.md` for the execution contract. QC evidence lives in `runtime/reports/codex-learning/`.

## Portable member package and setup

`install.py package --output ARCHIVE.zip` exports only generic code/instructions and a SHA-256 file manifest. It excludes local config, registry, runtime logs, personal state and trust. From the extracted package, Distribution invokes `install.py install --root MEMBER_OS --metadata ADMITTED_PROJECT_JSON --json` using its provisioned Python. Explicit runtime/provider overrides are supported when metadata is unavailable; dependency checks fail with setup guidance rather than copying another member's paths.

The installer generates local commands, preserves other hooks and local modifications, writes an ownership receipt, and supports idempotent reinstall/relocation plus owned-hook removal. `install.py setup`, `doctor` and `descriptor` expose resumable setup and member guidance in `SETUP.md`. The actual member Distribution release must admit this package; exporting a ZIP does not publish or update that release.

Windows has a native locking branch and command generation; native Windows/Linux release validation is still required. Mac fixture installation/relocation checks do not certify other platforms.

## Learning maintenance

`maintenance.py --root OS --scope operator report` produces content-free review coverage and typed owner counters. Unlabelled correctness is explicitly unknown. Optional operator feedback records evaluation labels by real Memory ID and canonical evidence reference; it never mutates historical truth.

A native desktop schedule is configured separately and must be disclosed to the operator. Local file review requires the computer and app running. Review scope stays explicit, unchanged states remain quiet, and Memory/Brain/Skills gates control any proposed write. A schedule is not an immediate invisible post-message reviewer.
